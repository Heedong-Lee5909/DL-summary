# Neurons and Neural Networks - Summary

Neural networks in deep learning are inspired by the structure and
function of biological neurons in the brain.

## Biological Neuron Structure

-   **Soma**: The main body of the neuron, containing the nucleus.
-   **Dendrites**: Branch-like structures that receive electrical
    impulses (data) from other neurons.
-   **Axon**: A long arm extending from the soma that carries processed
    information.
-   **Synapses (Terminal Buttons)**: The whisker-like ends of the axon
    that transmit the output to other neurons.

## How Biological Neurons Work

1.  **Input**: Dendrites receive impulses (information) from other
    neurons.
2.  **Processing**: The soma and its nucleus combine and process these
    signals.
3.  **Output**: The axon transmits the processed information to
    synapses.
4.  **Connection**: Synapses pass the signal to thousands of adjoining
    neurons.

Learning in the brain occurs by repeatedly activating certain neural
pathways, strengthening them when they lead to desired outcomes.

## Artificial Neurons

-   Inspired by biological neurons.
-   Also consist of **soma, dendrites, and an axon**.
-   Output from one artificial neuron can connect to many others.
-   Learning resembles biological reinforcement: repeated activation
    strengthens the network's performance.

## Key Takeaways

-   Deep learning algorithms are modeled after the brain's neurons and
    networks.
-   Biological neuron components (soma, dendrites, axon, synapses) map
    conceptually to artificial neuron design.
-   Both biological and artificial neurons learn through reinforcement
    of successful connections.
